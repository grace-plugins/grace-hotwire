# Grace with Hotwire

[Grace](https://github.com/graceframework/grace-framework) is an open-source and powerful One-Person web application Framework to help developers quickly build Spring Boot applications written in the Groovy programing language.

[Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev) gives you the speed of a single-page web application without having to write any JavaScript.

[Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev) is a JavaScript framework with modest ambitions. It doesn’t seek to take over your entire front-end—in fact, it’s not concerned with rendering HTML at all. Instead, it’s designed to augment your HTML with just enough behavior to make it shine. 

This plugin will help you to develop Grace app with Hotwire Turo and Stimulus.
